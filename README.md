## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```
4. Connect to Supabase using the "Connect to Supabase" button in the UI

### Database Setup

The application requires the following tables in Supabase:

1. `ai_tools` - Stores information about AI tools
2. `affiliate_programs` - Stores affiliate program information for each tool

The migration file in `supabase/migrations/create_initial_schema.sql` will create these tables for you.

### Importing Tools

Use the `src/utils/importTools.js` script to import your AI tools into the database:

```
node src/utils/importTools.js
```

You can modify this script to import your own data from a JSON file or other source.

### Running the Scraper

To start the affiliate program scraper:

```
npm run scrape
```

The scraper will:
1. Fetch pending tools from the database
2. Visit each tool's website to look for affiliate links
3. Search Google if no links are found on the website
4. Extract commission details and other information
5. Update the database with the results
6. Retry failed lookups up to 3 times

### Running the Dashboard

To start the dashboard:

```
npm run dev
```

The dashboard provides:
- Overview of scraping progress
- Detailed view of all affiliate programs found
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js scraper with Puppeteer and Cheerio
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching and caching
